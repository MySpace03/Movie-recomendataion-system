# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System**!  
This project leverages Python and data science tools to build a system that can recommend movies to users based on their preferences and historical ratings.

---

## 📋 Overview

- **Goal:** Analyze user-movie ratings data and implement algorithms that provide personalized movie recommendations.
- **Tech:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, popular libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis on movie ratings
- Collaborative filtering algorithms for recommendations
- User and movie profiling
- Practical demonstration in an interactive Jupyter Notebook
